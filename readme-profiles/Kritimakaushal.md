# Hello! I am Kritima!

##### I am a 3rd year student persuing **Bachelors of Technology** course from **Banasthali Vidyapith, Rajasthan.**
##### I love competitive Coding and I regularly participate in challenges on **CODECHEF.**
##### My preferred programming language is **JAVA**. Also I am interested in Java Backend Development.
##### I am currently learning Servlets and Spring MVC to build a project based on java backend technology.
##### I learnt about open source and Hacktober Fest recently and hence I have just started with a very few Pull Requests submissions. Hope to learn a lot from the Github Tech Community.
