Hello, I am Nyd3lig.

An aspiring web developer in the making from Norway!

Currently I am studying HTML, CSS and JS. And was challanged by a friend to join hacktober fest, so far I am having a lot of fun with git, and github, but it's a little confusing. 

But I hope with enough exposure I'll learn the way!
