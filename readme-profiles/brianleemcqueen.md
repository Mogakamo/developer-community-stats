My name is Brian.  I work in Indianapolis, IN, USA.  Since 2018, I have been working as a Scrum Master for a mobile development project.  When *Hacktoberfest 2020* was introduced, I decided to set sometime aside to start getting involved with the open source community.  My past development experience has been in:
* PHP
* Java
* .NET
* JavaScript

A quick writeup on some of the things I did in the 2010-2014 range is here:
