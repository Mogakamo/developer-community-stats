# Hello, friend!

## I'm **Fox** [^1] :fox_face:

I am a theatre worker-turned-student in the United States. My current focus is on network security and database management, but there's a special place in my heart for code. 

I'm participating in the 2020 Hackathon in an efort to get over my shyness and start working with others on projects I believe in. 

(Oh, and to get comfortable with **git**! That's a big one!)

I have been using **HTML** and **CSS** since I was in middle school, and I recently added **Javascript** into the mix. Other favorite languages to play in are **Python** and **C++**, and I hope to add **Ruby** to that list in the coming months.
